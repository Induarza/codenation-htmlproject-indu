					<p> I have graduated in Electrical Engineering in 2006 and completed my Master's in Human resource. Worked as Recruiter for 1 year in IT company, as got married and moved to the UK and because of family issues, I could not continue my work. Now that my kids started school, I would like to rebuild my career in the IT sector. That is how I came across Code Nation. I started the Cyber Security course with Code Nation and learned many things that are new in the market and got encouraged to go for the Coding course. So my goal is to get selected for the Master's Dev course thorough Apprenticeship program and get into an organization to grow personally and professionally with the Organisational growth.

					  iam here looking for the best solutions and to improve IT skills. So I choose Code Nations to quick start my career.
