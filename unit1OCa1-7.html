		<p>GDPR stands for the General Data Protection Regulation. Under GDPR, consents to digital marketing have raised to higher standards.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>	Active opt-in – Consent will require a positive opt-in through clear affirmative action.	</li>
			<li>	Granular – Individuals should get as much detail as possible on what their data will be processed for. Best practice will be to let individuals withdraw consent for each distinct processing activity. Blanket consent will not be compliant.	</li>
			<li>	Unbundling – Consent requests must be separated from terms and conditions	</li>
			<li>	Not a pre-condition of service – Consent should not be a precondition of signing up to a service unless necessary such as a newspaper subscription	</li>
			<li>	Named – It should be clear to the individual who will be processing their data including any third-parties.	</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Each country has different regulations around email marketing, and it’s important to remember that you must abide by the laws of the countries you send to, not just the one you operate in. The Internet is a wonderful source of information and entertainment, but it’s important to realise that there are a number of restrictions on what you can and cannot do online.</p>
		<br>
		<p>There are significant legal constraints on the uploading and downloading of software and other digital content, including music and videos. Many items are copyright and can incorporate digital rights management, such as restricting the number of times a media file can be copied or converted to another format. When you buy software, you will  normally receive a licence to use it. You do not own the software itself, nor do you have the right to copy it. Some types of licence, including freeware and shareware impose fewer restrictions.</p>
