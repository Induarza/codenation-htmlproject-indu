				Digital Projects
			</p>
		<p>Digital projects are products which are developed and delivered digitally. Digital research projects involve the transformation of objects of scholarly interest, including texts and images, into electronic form for specialised, enhanced, or remote analysis Nowadays, it can be almost anything. A software application, a website, an online campaign, etc. What is true for digital projects is that they're virtual products delivered as a service to the client.
		</p>
		<br>
	<br>
	<ul>
					<li>Methodologies of Digital Projects :</li>

							<li>Agile</li>
							<li>Scrum</li>
							<li>waterfalls</li>
							<li>PRINCE2</li>
							<br>

	</ul>
	<p>
							The methodologies are used to manage  digital projects. Agile and Scrum are very popular approaches  in these days in software development. No methodology is defined to be the best as some methodologies suit some projects and team and some suit other projects. According to the team and requirement in  the project they need to choose the methodology.A good Project Manager will be able to select and execute the right digital project management method for their team and project.

						A digital project comprises the planning, preparation, and production that goes into creating digital projects.A good Project Manager will be able to select and execute the right project management method for your team and type of project, but no matter the choice of methodology, most digital projects go through the same 5-steps.

			</p>
			<ol>

				<li>Scoping</li>
				<li>Planning</li>
				<li>Development</li>
				<li>Testing & Deployment</li>
				<li>Maintenance</li>

			</ol>
			<h2>1.Scoping includes:</h2>
			<br>
			<ul>

			<li>Collaboration within an organization and Partners with outside institutions  and requirements of clients.</li>
			<li>Team building and communication skills,ideas and brainstorming session.Listening and persuasion skills.</li>
			<li>Creating a business plan , discussing the scope, discussing milestones.</li>
			<li>Teams organising, distributing the tasks among the teams and to other teams.</li>
			<li>Discussing the initial cost requirements.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<h2>2.Planning:</h2>
			<ul>
			<li>	Overview of the steps of planning a digital project	</li>
			<li>	Examining the information needed to write a successful grant 	</li>
			<li>	After the first phase, the more detailed planning can begin. Discuss the functionality, requirements, and the flow chart to get there.	</li>
			<li>	The creative process is initiated. The user experience begins its formation using Wireframes, User Journeys, and Information Architecture to define the structure of content. This part of the process is often a collaboration between the teams of, User Experience (UX), Design, Marketing, and Development.	</li>
			<li>	A detailed plan for the implementation of the idea.	</li>
			<li>	Creative teams are engaged, and the consumer's user experience is initiated and designed.	</li>
			<li>	Requirements and design guidelines are handed over to Development in the next phase.	</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>3.Development</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>	Requirements and the rough design specifications should now be in place and handed over to the Development team.	</li>
				<li>	Developing team as to coordinate every day and start working on developing the code.	</li>
				<li>	The implementation can now begin.	</li>
				<li>	The back end team starts working on the coding. 	</li>
				<li>	The front end team will be working as well for more refinements.	</li>
				<li>	The back-end setup is crucial as a foundation for the following development and end experience.	</li>
				<li>	Alpha and Beta versions build on top of the back-end, and the final design specifications are send to tested by testers	</li>
				<li>	Final touches are made to get ready for Testing & Deployment.	</li>

			</ul>
			<h2>4.Testing & Deployment</h2>
			<p>Deployment is the final stage before the product will be in the hands of the end-user. It might sound simple, but Deployment is a crucial step. Everything needs to be tested and various use-cases must be taken into account. Quality Assessment (QA) of the code and final product is conducted, and the project goes live and is made available to the public.
			</p>
			<h3>Testing & Deployment includes:
			<ul>
				<li>	Testing of the code and use-cases and check if all requirements and specifications implemented successfully.	</li>
				<li>	Quality Assessment (QA) conducts an analysis of the final product before it is pushed live.	</li>
				<li>	If there are any errors or it doesnt work it will go back to developers and come back to testers again.	</li>
				<li>	Product is deployed and goes live.	</li>
				<li>	The project transforms into the Maintenance phase.	</li>


			</ul>
<h2>5. Maintenance</h2>
		<ul>
				<li>	After the product has been delivered, the Maintenance phase will take over.	</li>
				<li>	Maintenance is a continuous phase of improving functionality, stability, and offering support of the product. 	</li>
				<li>	Improvement of functionality and bug fixing depending on the nature of your project, further development may also be part of the current project or evolve into a second continuous project.	</li>
				<li>	Addressing stability issues and keeping the system running.	</li>

		</ul>
		<p>These are the general process on how the digital project uses. The project manager should make sure whole time they are following Scope ,budget, on time.
		</p>
		<h1>Tools
		</h1>
		<p>There is no doubt that any project head has to make decisions that could ultimately affect the stability and security of the  organization.The project needs to maintain Scope ,money and time. Every single project is important to organisation for future investment and adds value to the company. So there are lot of tools and techniques available choose which is better for the project
Tools improve efficiency of the project .The timeline is easly estimated and progress on deadlines.Everything we do requires coordination between departments,communication with clients,prioritizing the jobs.
So much to manage all at once and organizing the team and building stuff around is done through tools.
