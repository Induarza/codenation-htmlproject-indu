				<p>with recent boom of sophisticated tools and technologies the range of file types that have become appropriate has increased.  however, this selection can be broadly classified into below .</p>
				<br>
				<p>type of website:</p>
				<p>blogs: these types of websites do not contain much data of their own. Most of the data is generated by their users. For such websites dynamically generated HTML pages would suffice. But it should have the capability to accept images (JPEG, PNG, GIF), videos (MP4, MPEG-4) etc.</p>
				<p>most of the time these files would be of compressed formats such as listed above. </p>
				<p>e-Commerce websites: These type of websites would need to place lots of images on their sites. unlike blogs, the data in such websites is added by businessess. there is very less data user generates. E-commerce websites need to be fast to access, secure and give as many details as possible.</p>
