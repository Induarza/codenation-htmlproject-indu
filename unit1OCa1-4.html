			<p>Many failures associated with web applications development are the consequences of poor awareness of the risks involved and the weak management of these risks. The main objective of the study is to fill the information gap within web projects management by learning from the experiences of organizations who are already out there managing web projects. Additionally, the study investigates uncertainties that will affect web projects and the level of threat they pose to the success of web projects.</p>
