			<p>Visual Studio Code:</p>
			<p>As i was new to  developing of applications and web pages ,Visual Studio Code has been a very helpful tool since with it I have been able to work comfortably .Best thing for visual studio code is that it is multi platform like i can use it on windows, mac as well as linux. Its free for everyone.
				I think It's one of the most intelligent and easy to use software with a very organized UI. I can easily configure my git repositories and can access all the commits done on that repositories. Iwas writing HTML and CSS code in visual studio.
				Trello:</p>>
				<br>
				<p>Trello:</p>
				<p>Trello is an excellent tool in digital projects.It was easy to download and signup. Start using it immediately.It helped be organize and track all of our teams tasks, files, and information in one place.  A Trello board helped us in group projects and vwe had standups were we can speak about what have been done ,doing, need to be done.
