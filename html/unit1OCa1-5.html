				<p>Choosing software is not a quick or easy process. Many small business owners and managers know they need a new system but are put off by the number of competing products, the amount of time needed to evaluate each one, or a fear of choosing the wrong solution. We know you can’t afford to make a mistake, in small businesses we just don’t have resources to spare, so it’s important to get it right first time. Most of the small business give there Software systems outsourcing. </p>
			<p>1. Know your objective</p>
			<ul>
			<li>	Know the process. What must the system do?	</li>
			<li>	Know the pain points. What problems must the new solution solve?	</li>
			<li>	Know it’s value. What would a solution be worth?	</li>
			<p>2. Create a list of software requirements</p>
			<li>	Functional requirements	</li>
				<li>		</li>
				<li>	Usability requirements.	</li>
				<li>		</li>
				<li>	Technological preferences.	</li>
				<li>		</li>
				<li>	Budgetary requirements.	</li>
				<li>		</li>
				<li>	Reporting requirements	</li>
				<li>		</li>
				<li>	Scalability	</li>
				<p>3. Start searching for relevant applications</p>
				<li>It’s best to put them into a spreadsheet, ready for comparing later. At this point though, don’t waste time evaluating the systems, just list them all out. </li>
				<p>4. Start excluding solutions</p>
				<li>	Technology preferences. If it only works on Macs and you are on Windows, great, that’s one less to look at. If it is on-premises, and you’re looking for a cloud-based solution – cross it off the list.	</li>
				<li> </li>
				<li>	Budget. If it is too expensive, make a note of the price and move on.	</li>

				<p>5.   Start trialling your selected software:</p>
				<li>	Learnability	</li>
				<li>		</li>
				<li>	Efficiency	</li>
				<li>		</li>
				<li>	Errors	</li>
				<li>		</li>
				<li>	Satisfaction	</li>
