			<p>I have choosen Trello as the tool to develop a website. Infact we started to use Trello from the day one of our study in Code nation. i have registered my self in Trello which is free download. And Trello is user frendly , have started using all the properties and tools in trello easly.</p>
			<p> Trello was very helpful in organising the plan. we have used Trello for group project which involved three people in the team and developing a game in python.</p>
			<ul>
			<li>	Making a group board in the Trello,where all the three people in the team can share same information and discuss .	</li>
			<li>	setting up standUps carts.	</li>
			<li>	Discussing what need to be done.	</li>
			<li>	what we all where doing .	</li>
			<li>	what has completed on that day.	</li>
			<li>	And what kind of expectation we has with the project.	</li>
			<p>Trello was very helpful with the Website developing</p>
			<li> Ihave created a private board in trello and started making cards</li>
			<li>what need to be done, course work,html page and CSS page </li>
			<li>what i was doing</li>
			<li>what i have been completed</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Organize and track all of your teams tasks, files, and information in one place.It was easy with trello answering all the faculty questions.</p>
