			<p>IT is  everywhere the world ,we are surrounded by IT technologies, it plays a prominent role in the our day to day life .The moment we get up from sleep and the time we go back to sleep ,we are using all the technology in the world. Now we can say that Information Technologies have grown and expanded rapidly ,one can say that the whole galaxy is surrounded by technology. That is why my theme of this web page is called Cyber Galaxy. The cyber world around is so vast ,creative,fast and also as one can say new things new danger. That is where we get cyber crimes . So IT plays a prominent role in modern businesses, the more new technology the more risk and in business prospective the companies have to learn about new technologies to grow as well as protect the business .We are at crossroads as we move from a society already entwined with the internet to the coming age of automation, Big Data, and the Internet of Things (IoT).But as a society that runs largely on technology, we are also as a result dependent on it.

			</p><br>
			<p>And just as technology brings ever greater benefits, it also brings ever greater threats: by the very nature of the opportunities it presents it becomes a focal point for cyber crime, industrial espionage, and cyber attacks. Therefore, protecting it is of paramount priority.
